## 🔍 Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration  
- Explored dataset structure (rows, columns, data types).  

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values (removed/replaced).  
- Dropped unnecessary columns and removed duplicates.  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze trends, distributions, and outliers.  

### 4. Feature Engineering  
- Created new fields: **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**, **Gross Profit**, and **Status (Profit/Loss)**.  

### 5. Tableau Dashboard  
- Exported cleaned data to Tableau.  
- Added calculated fields and KPIs.  
- Designed wireframe and dashboard layout.  
- Built an **interactive dashboard** to visualize sales and profitability.
